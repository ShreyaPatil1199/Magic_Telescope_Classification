# Magic_Telescope_Classification
Welcome to the MAGIC Gamma Telescope project! ðŸŒŒ The mission is to classify gamma rays and hadrons in astrophysics using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ensemble. The primary objective is to develop a classification prediction system capable of distinguishing between gamma rays and hadrons in the field of astrophysics.

Classifying Gamma and Hadron rays is of paramount importance in unravelling the mysteries of the universe, and the valuable MAGIC Telescope dataset aids us in achieving this goal. To accomplish this task, various machine learning techniques are employed, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ensemble Techniques, to predict and differentiate between these high-energy particles.

The ultimate aim is to create a reliable and accurate prediction model that effectively classifies Gamma and Hadron rays. ðŸš€ #Astrophysics #MachineLearning
